Paper Reproduction: OW-DETR: Open-world Detection Transformer (CVPR 2022)

The release of souce code (https://github.com/akshitac8/OW-DETR) carries out experienments in mulitple tasks such as incremental object detection and 
semantic segmentation, and designed a series of optional architechure. Besides, there are some errors in the file structure and Readme.Therefore, it 
is too redundancy to reproduce a owdetr for pure object detection. 

Here, I reproduce the one-stage owdetr with box refinement only for incremental object detection.
